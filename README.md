# rusty-interpreter

# What
I came across Thorsten Ball's books: *Writing an Interpreter in Go* and *Writing a Compiler in Go* and looking at others' reviews of the books, it seems like it's highly recommended. I've never built an interpreter or a compiler before and, admittedly, my understanding of either is pretty high-level.

This project, specifically, will be focused on following the first book: *Writing an Interpreter in Go*. There will be a follow-up project to go through the compiler-focused book once this project is done.

It should be stated, the intent of this project is **not** to simply "follow a tutorial." The books will act as more of a guide, directing my attention and providing some structure as I dive down the unknown waters that are interpreters/compilers. 

# Goals
1. Gain deeper knowledge on interpreters and how they work under-the-hood; the design patterns, architecture, and first principles.
2. Expand Rust language knowledge and proficiency
3. Build a working interpreter

# Requirements
1. For the interpreter portion of this project, we'll follow this hierarchy of resources to use:
	1. Writing an Interpreter in Go
	2. [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)
	3. Find blog posts or articles about interpreter design/architecture
	4. No LLM!
2. For the Rust-specific portion of this project, we'll follow this hierarchy of resources to use:
	1. [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) for any language specific questions or issues
	2. Rust by Rustaceans book
	3. Resources in [blog posts/resources from pretzelhammer](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog)
	4. Google-fu
	5. No LLM!
